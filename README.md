Hello! Welcome to the Chaos Game!

The Chaos Game is a mathematical method of fractal creation.
For a in-depth description of Chaos Game, consult the internet or Instructions Page in program.

This program allows user to tweak the start and run conditions of the Chaos Game such as
the speed, size, number, color, placement, and shape of iterations.

Note 1: Program throws a ConcurrentEnrollmentException if resizing the window during iteration (or other things).
This exception is exceptionally hard to get rid of, so try not to throw it.
It does not effect running of program, only something I shohuldn't be doing.
I will take a look into providing a permanent fix eventually.

Note 2: I was having issues with multiple restrictions, so i will fix that later.
I have decided that getting other programs working and uploaded are more important.
So the second restriction box will be disabled and fixed later.

Note 3: The code is pretty messy. I may clean it up if I find the time,
but for now there are more important things I should be spending time on.
